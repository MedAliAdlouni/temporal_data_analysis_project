# Sunspot Time Series Analysis (1700–1988)

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and models the time series of sunspot activity from 1700 to 1988. The goal is to explore trends, clean and visualize the data, and apply statistical models to forecast future sunspot counts.

## 📈 Dataset
The dataset consists of yearly sunspot counts between 1700 and 1988, commonly used in time series forecasting tasks.


## 📊 Methods Used
- Time series decomposition
- Data cleaning and visualization
- Statistical modeling with SARIMA
- Forecast evaluation and validation
